# lego-crawler

A web crawler written using Scrapy and Python 3 that walks through BrickSet and extracts important LEGO data.
Made following the wonderful tutorial at [DigitalOcean Community](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-crawl-a-web-page-with-scrapy-and-python-3) to learn about web crawling with a nice project.
