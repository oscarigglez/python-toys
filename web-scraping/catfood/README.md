# catfood

My first *actually interesting* web-crawling-based project!

Setting: I want to identify the best brands of cat food for my lovely hypothetical cats Neutrino and Kirby.
Idea: I can crawl the wonderful website [CatFoodDB](http://catfooddb.com/), collect a few features and data about each of the reviewed products, organize them into a neat table, and then perform some data analysis on them.
Tools: Scrapy, Seaborn
